# Wordpress in K8s

The idea of this project is to set a template on how I would like to set up a wordpress project

### Features

##### Running on K8s

I heard that running WP in K8s is an overkill

But with the current self managed solutions like EKS or Digitalocean Kubernetes

And all the good thinks that K8s ships built in I think it worth it


##### Observability

Metrics: Prometheus

Dashboards: Grafana

Logs: Loki
